# AlexandreRecognition-CNN
Convolutional Neural Network trained in order to recognize its master (me); LEVEQUE Alexandre.

It uses data from http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/?fbclid=IwAR3OadbiKWi1UdXlu92Po0KQ49nG7uHXYt05Ckq5MD71XtECRgwnlgWgs1s .
I uploaded my own photos to provide data to recognize me to the model.

The notebook itself is inspired by a work from
